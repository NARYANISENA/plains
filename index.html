    <h2>The Himalayas</h2>
    <p>The Himalayas, often referred to as the "Abode of Snow," are the world's youngest and highest mountain range. Spanning over 2,400 kilometers across five countries, they are home to Mount Everest, the highest peak on Earth. The range is divided into three parts: the Greater Himalayas (Himadri), the Lesser Himalayas (Himachal), and the Outer Himalayas (Shivaliks).Stretching across five countries—India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan—the Himalayas are a remarkable geographical feature and a significant cultural and ecological landmark.</p>
